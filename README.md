# Ethereum Validator - Automated Setup
Install and configure an Ethereum Validator (mainnet/testnet) in 1 click, as opposed to hours normally spent on manual configuration.  

Now updated to include multiple clients (geth, besu, nethermind, teku, nimbus, lighthouse, prysm)


# Summary

Python script that simplifies and automates the installation and configuration of the Ethereum validator node.

It's based on [Somer Esat's - Lighthouse/Geth](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-ubuntu-lighthouse-773f5d982e03) guide and has been expanded to include multple execution and consensus engines with a single Python script to automate the setup process.

**Important Note:** This script does not generate any security-related items such as validator keystore, deposit data, or mnemonic. It simply prepares the node for staking by installing the binaries, creating users, writing service files, etc.

After running the script, Geth and Ligthouse (or whichever clients you choose) will be installed and fully configured to begin syncing.

If you want to run a full validator, you'll also need to import an existing keystore or generate new keystores to run the validator. 

You can follow [Somer's guide](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-ubuntu-lighthouse-773f5d982e03) to safely generate keys offline and import the keystores.

# Validator Update Script

`vaildator_update.py` is a simple Python script to update the execution and consensus client of your choice. 

Supports: Geth, Besu, Nethermind, Teku, Nimbus, Lighthouse, and Prysm.

**To run the update script, use these commands:**

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install git`

`pip install requests`

`git clone https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-install.git`

`python3 validator-install/validator_update.py`  

# Validator Install Script

The `validator_install.py` script performs the following tasks:

1) Choose Ethereum network (mainnet, goerli, sepolia).
2) Choose Execution Client (Nethermind, Besu, Geth)
3) Choose Consensus Client (Nimbus, Teku, Lighthouse, Prysm)
4) Lets you set an Ethereum address for validator tips (optional).
5) Lets you set Checkpoint Sync URL (optional).
6) Installs and configures Universal Firewall (ufw).
7) Creates necessary users, directories, and files.
8) Downloads and installs the latest client binaries.
9) Writes and saves service files for Execution, Beacon, and Validator.
10) Displays a summary of the installation.

**To run the script, use these commands:**

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed

2. Install git, if not already installed

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

3. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/accidental-green/validator-install.git
```

4. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the script

```
python3 validator-install/validator_install_multi.py
```

<br />  

**After successful installation, you can start the services:**

Note: Change name of client (geth, besu, nethermind, teku, nimbus, lighthousebeacon, lighthousevalidator, prysmbeacon, prysmvalidator)

`sudo systemctl start geth`

`sudo systemctl start lighthousebeacon`

`sudo systemctl start lighthousevalidator`

<br />

**Open 3 new terminals (`ctrl+alt+t`) and view the journals:**

`sudo journalctl -fu geth.service`

`sudo journalctl -fu lighthousebeacon.service`

`sudo journalctl -fu lighthousevalidator.service`

\
The services should start, find peers, and eventually begin syncing. If you notice any errors (red/yellow), visit [EthStaker Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ucsTcA2wTq) for help.


You can stop the services by changing the "start" commands to "stop".


That's it, happpy staking! Feel free to contribute to the project if you'd like to add other clients!
